Description: 
  This package implements a stochastic modeling framework for lexical semantic change,
  particularly focused on the competition between word senses over time. The framework
  integrates Bayesian inference with Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to estimate 
  parameters of a two-sense competition model. The package also includes functions for 
  simulating SDE trajectories, conducting MCMC inference, and visualizing results related 
  to lexical-semantic evolution in historical corpora.
